     A Distributed Systems Reading List</p>
     <p> Introduction</p>

<p> I often argue that the toughest thing about distributed systems is changing the way you think. The below is a collection of material I've found useful for motivating these changes.</p>

<p> Thought Provokers</p>

<p> Ramblings that make you think about the way you design. Not everything can be solved with big servers, databases and transactions.</p>

<p> Harvest, Yield and Scalable Tolerant Systems - Real world applications of CAP from Brewer et al</p>
<p> On Designing and Deploying Internet Scale Services - James Hamilton</p>
<p> The Perils of Good Abstractions - Building the perfect API/interface is difficult</p>
<p> Chaotic Perspectives - Large scale systems are everything developers dislike - unpredictable, unordered and parallel</p>
<p> Data on the Outside versus Data on the Inside - Pat Helland</p>
<p> Memories, Guesses and Apologies - Pat Helland</p>
<p> SOA and Newton's Universe - Pat Helland</p>
<p> Building on Quicksand - Pat Helland</p>
<p> Why Distributed Computing? - Jim Waldo</p>
<p> A Note on Distributed Computing - Waldo, Wollrath et al</p>
<p> Stevey's Google Platforms Rant - Yegge's SOA platform experience</p>

  <p> Latency</p>

<p> Latency Exists, Cope! - Commentary on coping with latency and it's architectural impacts</p>
<p> Latency - the new web performance bottleneck - not at all new (see Patterson), but noteworthy</p>
<p> The Tail At Scale - the latencychallenges inherent of dealing with latency in large scale systems</p>

       <p> Amazon</p>

<p> Somewhat about the technology but more interesting is the culture and organization they've created to work with it.
</p>
<p> A Conversation with Werner Vogels - Coverage of Amazon's transition to a service-based architecture</p>
<p> Discipline and Focus - Additional coverage of Amazon's transition to a service-based architecture</p>
<p> Vogels on Scalability</p>
<p> SOA creates order out of chaos @ Amazon</p>

  <p> Google</p>

<p> Current "rocket science" in distributed systems.</p>

<p> MapReduce</p>
<p> Chubby Lock Manager</p>
<p> Google File System</p>
<p> BigTable</p>
<p> Data Management for Internet-Scale Single-Sign-On</p>
<p> Dremel: Interactive Analysis of Web-Scale Datasets</p>
<p> Large-scale Incremental Processing Using Distributed Transactions and Notifications</p>
<p> Megastore: Providing Scalable, Highly Available Storage for Interactive Services - Smart design for low latency Paxos implementation across datacentres.</p>
<p> Spanner - Google's scalable, multi-version, globally-distributed, and synchronously-replicated database.</p>
<p> Photon - Fault-tolerant and Scalable Joining of Continuous Data Streams. Joins are tough especially with time-skew, high availability and distribution.</p>
<p> Mesa: Geo-Replicated, Near Real-Time, Scalable Data Warehousing - Data warehousing system that stores critical measurement data related to Google's Internet advertising business.
</p>
  <p> Consistency Models</p>

<p> Key to building systems that suit their environments is finding the right tradeoff between consistency and availability.
</p>
<p> CAP Conjecture - Consistency, Availability, Parition Tolerance cannot all be satisfied at once</p>
<p> Consistency, Availability, and Convergence - Proves the upper bound for consistency possible in a typical system</p>
<p> CAP Twelve Years Later: How the "Rules" Have Changed - Eric Brewer expands on the original tradeoff description</p>
<p> Consistency and Availability - Vogels</p>
<p> Eventual Consistency - Vogels</p>
<p> Avoiding Two-Phase Commit - Two phase commit avoidance approaches</p>
<p> 2PC or not 2PC, Wherefore Art Thou XA? - Two phase commit isn't a silver bullet</p>
<p> Life Beyond Distributed Transactions - Helland</p>
<p> If you have too much data, then 'good enough' is good enough - NoSQL, Future of data theory - Pat Helland</p>
<p> Starbucks doesn't do two phase commit - Asynchronous mechanisms at work</p>
<p> You Can't Sacrifice Partition Tolerance - Additional CAP commentary</p>
<p> Optimistic Replication - Relaxed consistency approaches for data replication</p>
